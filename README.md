[MvcPages][1]
=============
MvcPages combines the simplicity of ASP.NET Web Pages with the
power of ASP.NET MVC. Use model binding, model validation,
strongly-typed HTML helpers, editor and display templates, etc.
directly from your Razor pages, no need for routes or controllers.

See the [project home][1] and the [documentation][2] for more information.
